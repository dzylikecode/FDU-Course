今天我的主题是哈密顿原理. 当然, 我不是为了炫耀专业知识去介绍它的数学理论. 我仅仅想提供一种根植于其中的哲学思想, 提供一种看待世界的视角. 

One of the central philosophical ideas behind the Hamilton Principle is the economy of nature. This concept suggests that nature operates in the most efficient way possible, choosing paths that minimize or make stationary a certain quantity, which in this case is the action. This idea is reminiscent of the principle of least effort or minimal energy expenditure, which is seen in various natural phenomena. For example, light travels in a straight line because it takes the shortest path between two points. 光发生折射是因为它在两种介质中的速度不同, 为了保持时间最小, 它会选择折射的角度.

它可以帮助我们解释一些人类现象. 找到合适的目标是关键. 比如为了减少能量的损耗, 人总是以不快不慢, 舒适稳定的步伐走路. 如何解释有的人会一边听课, 一边看直播呢? 从获取信息最大化的角度而言, 他们无法吸收课堂中的一部分信息, 为此他们选择另外一种更为轻松容易的方式来弥补. 虽然最快捷的路不一定是最便捷的路.

用Hamilton思考的时候, 有的问题的目标不是那么明显. 我们需要从成本切入. 经济学中的概念叫做机会成本. 比如, 当就业环境好的时候, 人们会选择更多的时间去工作. 尽管读研可以帮助他们获得更好待遇, 但是三年的读书时间他们本该可以赚取一笔可观的钱财, 对于读研而言这是一笔巨大成本.

当追求最优的时候, 往往会在局部上也追求最优, 经济学上叫做边际效用. 比如你在购买电影票的时候, 你发现加一块钱, 你可以拥有爆米花和饮料, 这时候通常会选择后者

以上就是我对Hamilton原理的理解和感悟, 分享给大家

Today, my topic is the Hamilton Principle. Of course, I'm not here to show off my expertise by delving into its mathematical theory. I simply want to present the philosophical idea rooted in it, offering a perspective on how to view the world.

One of the central philosophical ideas behind the Hamilton Principle is the economy of nature. This concept suggests that nature operates in the most efficient way possible, choosing paths that minimize or make stationary a certain quantity, which in this case is the action. For example, light travels in a straight line because it takes the shortest path between two points. Light refracts because it travels at different speeds in different media. To minimize time, it chooses the angle of refraction.

Hamilton Principle can help us explain some human phenomena as well. The key is to find the right goal. For instance, to reduce energy loss, people always walk at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow, but comfortable and stable. How do we explain why some people listen to lectures while watching live streams? From the perspective of maximizing information acquisition, they cannot fully absorb some of the information from the lecture, so they choose another easier way to compensate. However, the easiest way is not always the fastest way.

When thinking with Hamilton's principle, some problems do not have obvious goals. We need to consider the costs, which is called opportunity cost in economics. For example, when the job market is good, people will choose to work more. Although pursuing a master's degree can help them achieve better pay, the three years spent studying could have been used to earn a considerable amount of money, which is a huge cost for pursuing a master's degree.

When pursuing the optimal, one often seeks local optimals as well, which in economics is called marginal utility. For instance, when you buy a movie ticket and find that adding one more dollar gets you popcorn and a drink, you tend to add one more dollar.

These are my understandings and reflections on the Hamilton Principle, thank you.
