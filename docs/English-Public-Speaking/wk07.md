## task two

Hello, Daddy and mom, can you hear me? Today, my speech is specially prepared for you. I really really hope you can develop your own interests and love yourselves.

### attention

I know you are busy with work, striving for a better life for our family. To achieve that, you have neglected yourselves and sacrifice your own interests and hobbies. You always say that my happiness is your happiness, insisting that spending more time on me is the most important thing, your own feelings shouldn't be taken account.

### need

But I must correct you that it's a wrong view. Sacrifice for others is not always right, even if for your son, me. It plants a dangerous seed in my mind that I can do harm to myself for something. I know this is not your prime intention, instead you always emphasize to me to take care of myself, but actually what you do affects me subtly. On the other hand, long-term neglect of yourself has begun to bite you back. Have you noticed that you get mad easily recently? Have you found that you are so addicted to the mobile phone and our communication becomes less? I am not blaming you. I know the source of these are from the stress of life, but I have to point out the fact that some of these are the consequences of your sacrifice and I want to encourage you to love yourself again, as your parents wish. It's time to strive for your own happiness.

### satisfaction

The first thing is to change your view and start to value yourself. It's important to recognize that you are not only parents, but also individuals. Based on that, try developing your own interests and hobbies. It not only improve your happiness about life, but also bring the enthusiam to our family. I will be pround of that my parents are young at heart and have a spiritually rich life, which is the precious treasure of our family. At last, don't worry about me. I understand your love for me. I'm twenty and able to think independently. When you spend more time on yourself, ask me to share some housework, I know it's time to take responsibility for myself and our family.

### visualization

Imagine that you pick up some days for yourselves to do what you like. For example, you can hang out together, experience a wonderful concert, make new friends. After that, you have a video chat with me to share the funny things along your travel. At that time, won't you feel how young we are and how happy we are. We are growing up in the different way and connecting with each other.

### action

So, stop being hard on yourself, I hope you can change to some lighter job. Then recall the thing you like to do in the past, and rediscover your hobbies. I can't wait to hear the story about your new life shared by you.

## task two improved by GPT

Dear Mom and Dad,

Can you hear me? Today, I have prepared a special speech just for you. I really hope that you can develop your own interests and learn to love yourselves.

I understand that you are both busy with work, striving to provide a better life for our family. In doing so, you have neglected your own passions and sacrificed your own well-being. You always say that my happiness is your happiness, and you believe that dedicating more time to me is the most important thing, often dismissing your own needs.

However, I want to bring your attention to something important. Sacrificing yourself for others is not always the right thing to do, even if it is for your own child like me. It plants a dangerous seed in my mind that I can harm myself for the sake of something or someone else. I know that this is not your intention, as you always emphasize the importance of taking care of myself. But the truth is, your actions subtly affect me. Additionally, neglecting yourselves for an extended period of time is starting to take its toll. Have you noticed how easily you get angry lately? Have you realized how addicted you have become to your mobile phones, leading to less communication between us? Please understand that I am not blaming you. I know that these issues stem from the stresses of life. However, I feel compelled to point out that some of these consequences are a result of your self-sacrifice. I want to encourage you to love yourselves again, just as your parents would want. It's time to strive for your own happiness.

The first step is to change your perspective and start valuing yourselves. Recognize that you are not just parents, but individuals with your own dreams and desires. By embracing this notion, you can begin to explore your own interests and hobbies. Not only will this enhance your happiness and fulfillment in life, but it will also bring renewed enthusiasm to our family. I would be incredibly proud to have parents who are young at heart and lead spiritually rich lives. It is a precious treasure for our family. And please, do not worry about me. I understand your love and concern for me. I am now twenty years old and capable of independent thought. When you dedicate more time to yourselves and ask me to share in the household responsibilities, I know it's time for me to take responsibility for myself and contribute to our family.

Now, let's visualize a brighter future together. Imagine setting aside some days just for yourselves, indulging in activities you truly enjoy. You could go on outings, experience a wonderful concert, or make new friends. Afterwards, we can have a video chat where you share the funny and exciting moments from your adventures. In that moment, won't you feel how young and happy we are? We will be growing individually in our own unique ways, yet still deeply connected.

So, stop being so hard on yourselves. I hope you can consider transitioning to lighter jobs that bring you joy. Take a moment to reflect on the things you used to love doing and rediscover your hobbies. I can't wait to hear the stories of your new lives, eagerly shared by both of you.

Thank you for listening to my speech. I believe in both of you, and I know that you have the strength and courage to make these changes. Let's embark on this journey together and create a happier, more fulfilled family.

With all my love,

Your Child
