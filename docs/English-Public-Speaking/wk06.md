There are three basic elements of introduction: the hook, the transition and the thesis. A well-formed introduction has these features. The hook should be interesting, specific and short. The transition provides the necessary background information to convince the readers that the topic is relevant to them. The thesis includes the purpose and the focus. A good structure of it is to end with a single sentence that summarizes the overall main point you are going to make in the rest of your paper.

Next I will give you some suggestions to improve your introduction:

- startling statistics or surprising facts to enhance the reality of your topic
- a common misconception to intrigue your readers
- a real-world situation to make your audience immersive
- a thought-provoking question to arise your readers' curiosity
- historical context to give the background information they don't know
- humor, it make your speech more joyful

During the introduction, you'd better avoid two points which will lower the quality of your speech:

- Avoid giving details and long explanation, which will bore your audience.
- Never apologize. You may want to be modest, but people want you to do a good job.
