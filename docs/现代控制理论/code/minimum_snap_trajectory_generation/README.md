## Required
1. MATLAB(R2013a is tested)

## How to run
There are 4 demo codes in 2D space, you can directly run these and see results.

 - demo1: minimum snap trajectory planning with waypoints **strong constrants**(equality constraints).
 - demo2: minimum snap trajectory planning with **corridor constraints**(iequality constraints).
 - demo3: minimum snap trajectory planning with waypoints strong constrants by **close form** solution.
 - demo4: minimum snap trajectory planning with **guiding path**
